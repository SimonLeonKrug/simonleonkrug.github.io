Welcome to my webpage! My name is Simon, I am a postdoc researching golden-rule instanton theory in the group of [Jeremy Richardson](https://www.richardson.ethz.ch/people/jeremy-richardson.html) at ETH Zürich. In addition to my inclination towards theoretical physics, I have a passion for tutoring and teaching.
