Welcome to my webpage! My name is Simon, I am a postdoc researching instanton theory (see e.g. [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48463-2)) in the group of [Jeremy Richardson](https://www.richardson.ethz.ch/people/jeremy-richardson.html) at ETH Zurich. In addition to my inclination towards theoretical physics, I have a passion for tutoring and teaching.
