Welcome to my webpage! My name is Simon, I am a fourth-year PhD student researching method development in quantum alchemy, an interdisciplinary field between computational chemistry, materials science and theoretical physics. In addition to my inclination towards theoretical physics, I have a passion for tutoring and teaching.
